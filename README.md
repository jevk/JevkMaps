# Jevk Maps
You might know some of my Beat Saber maps, like <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWWxWBH87aM">ANOMALY</a> or <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NicNQA67NqE">Conflict</a>. This repo is pretty much where I store all my <b>published</b> modcharts' scripts. I don't want to see anyone straight up copying this stuff. I made this repo, so that people can learn how I do modcharts.
