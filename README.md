# Jevk Maps
You might know some of my Beat Saber maps, like <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWWxWBH87aM">ANOMALY</a> or <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NicNQA67NqE">Conflict</a>. This repo is pretty much where I store all my <b>published</b> modcharts' scripts. I don't want to see anyone straight up copying this stuff. I made this repo, so that people can learn how I do modcharts.

## What is this?
This is just a repo filled with my scripts, all the environment stuff is free to use but you have to ask for a permission to use a noodle function!

### How do I know what's an environment script
It's simple, in the script, everything that's under <code>_environment.push</code>

### Want to use my functions?
If you want to use a certain effect, please ask about it on Discord: Jevk#0004
